# Gmail Delivery Fix Guide

Complete guide to fix email delivery to Gmail and other major providers.

## Problem: Emails work locally but Gmail blocks them on production

This is **very common** and happens because Gmail has strict requirements for email delivery.

---

## Quick Diagnosis

Run this diagnostic tool on your production server:

```bash
cd /var/www/website-with-auth-secured
node fix-gmail-delivery.js
```

This will check:
- ✅ SPF records
- ✅ DKIM configuration
- ✅ DMARC policy
- ✅ IP reputation
- ✅ DNS configuration

---

## Why Gmail Blocks Your Emails

### Main Reasons:

1. **Missing SPF Record** - Gmail can't verify you're authorized to send from this domain
2. **No DKIM Signature** - Emails aren't cryptographically signed
3. **No DMARC Policy** - No authentication policy set
4. **Poor IP Reputation** - Sending from blacklisted or residential IP
5. **Suspicious Patterns** - New sender with sudden volume

### Gmail's Requirements:

✅ **Required:**
- Valid SPF record
- DKIM signing
- DMARC policy
- Clean IP reputation
- Reverse DNS (PTR record)
- TLS encryption

❌ **What Gmail Rejects:**
- Emails without SPF/DKIM
- Emails from blacklisted IPs
- Emails from residential/dynamic IPs
- Suspicious content patterns
- High bounce/complaint rates

## Solution 2: Configure DNS Records (Technical)

If you want to keep using your current SMTP server, you need proper DNS configuration.

### Step 1: Add SPF Record

SPF tells Gmail you're authorized to send from your domain.

**DNS Record Type:** TXT
**Name:** @ (or your domain)
**Value:**
```
v=spf1 mx a include:smtp.sbc-servicesinc.com ~all
```

**How to Add:**
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Go to DNS Management
3. Add new TXT record
4. Wait 1-24 hours for propagation

**Verify:**
```bash
dig txt yourdomain.com
# or
nslookup -type=txt yourdomain.com
```

---

### Step 2: Configure DKIM

DKIM cryptographically signs your emails.

**How to Set Up:**

1. **Contact your email provider** (SBC Services / Hostgator)
   - Ask them to enable DKIM for your domain
   - They'll provide a DNS record to add

2. **Add DKIM DNS record** (they'll give you exact values)
   - Type: TXT
   - Name: `default._domainkey` (or selector they provide)
   - Value: Long string starting with `v=DKIM1`

3. **Wait for propagation** (1-24 hours)

**Verify:**
```bash
dig txt default._domainkey.yourdomain.com
```

---

### Step 3: Add DMARC Record

DMARC sets your email authentication policy.

**DNS Record Type:** TXT
**Name:** `_dmarc`
**Value:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

**Explanation:**
- `p=quarantine` - Suspicious emails go to spam
- `p=reject` - Suspicious emails are rejected
- `p=none` - Just monitor (start with this)
- `rua=` - Where to send reports

**Start with this for testing:**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:admin@yourdomain.com
```

**Verify:**
```bash
dig txt _dmarc.yourdomain.com
```

---

### Step 4: Check Reverse DNS (PTR Record)

Your server IP should have a reverse DNS pointing to your domain.

**Check:**
```bash
host your-server-ip
# Should return something like: mail.yourdomain.com
```

**How to Set:**
- Contact your hosting provider (only they can set PTR records)
- Request: "Please set PTR record for IP X.X.X.X to mail.yourdomain.com"

---

## Solution 3: IP Reputation Issues

### Check if Your IP is Blacklisted

```bash
# On production server
curl -s ifconfig.me
# Note your IP

# Then check these sites:
# https://mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx
# https://multirbl.valli.org/
```

### If Blacklisted:

1. **Find out why:**
   - Each blacklist has a lookup tool
   - They'll tell you the reason

2. **Fix the issue:**
   - Stop any spam/compromised accounts
   - Secure your server
   - Fix email authentication

3. **Request delisting:**
   - Most blacklists have automatic removal
   - Some require manual requests

### If Using Shared Hosting:

**Problem:** Your IP is shared with other customers, their actions affect you.

**Solution:**
- Use SMTP relay service (SendGrid, etc.)
- Or upgrade to dedicated IP
- Or use VPS/dedicated server

---

## Solution 4: Content & Pattern Improvements

Even with perfect DNS, content matters:

### ✅ Good Practices:

1. **Use consistent From address**
   ```env
   EMAIL_FROM=Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>
   ```

2. **Set proper Reply-To**
   ```javascript
   replyTo: 'support@yourdomain.com'
   ```

3. **Include unsubscribe link**
   ```html
   <a href="{unsubscribe_url}">Unsubscribe</a>
   ```

4. **Balance text/HTML**
   - Include plain text version
   - Don't use just images

5. **Avoid spam triggers:**
   - ❌ "FREE", "ACT NOW", all caps
   - ❌ Too many exclamation marks!!!
   - ❌ Suspicious links
   - ❌ Large images, no text

6. **Start slow:**
   - Don't send 1000 emails on day one
   - Build reputation gradually
   - Gmail monitors sending patterns

---

## Testing & Verification

### Step 1: Test with Mail-Tester.com

```bash
# 1. Go to https://www.mail-tester.com/
# 2. Copy the temporary email address shown
# 3. Send test email to that address
node test-email-production.js temp-address@mail-tester.com

# 4. Click "Then check your score"
# 5. Fix issues listed
```

**Target Score:** 10/10 (or at least 8+/10)

---

### Step 2: Send to Gmail and Check Headers

```bash
# Send test email
node test-email-production.js your-gmail@gmail.com

# In Gmail:
# 1. Open the email
# 2. Click three dots (⋮)
# 3. Click "Show original"
# 4. Check for:
```

**What to Look For:**

✅ **SPF:** Should show "PASS"
```
spf=pass (google.com: domain of sender@yourdomain.com designates IP as permitted sender)
```

✅ **DKIM:** Should show "PASS"
```
dkim=pass header.d=yourdomain.com
```

✅ **DMARC:** Should show "PASS"
```
dmarc=pass (p=NONE sp=NONE dis=NONE)
```

❌ **If FAIL:** Your DNS records aren't configured correctly

---

### Step 3: Monitor with Google Postmaster

```
1. Sign up: https://postmaster.google.com/
2. Verify your domain
3. Monitor:
   - Spam rate
   - IP reputation
   - Domain reputation
   - Authentication rate
```

**What Good Looks Like:**
- Spam rate: <0.1%
- IP reputation: High
- Authentication: 100% DKIM, SPF, DMARC pass

## Troubleshooting

### "SPF record added but Gmail still blocks"

**Wait time:** DNS propagation takes 1-24 hours

**Verify propagation:**
```bash
dig txt yourdomain.com
```

**Check Gmail headers** after propagation to see if SPF passes

---

### "DKIM record added but emails still fail"

**Common issues:**
- Wrong selector (should match what email server uses)
- Typo in DNS record
- Email server not actually signing emails

**Solution:**
- Contact email provider to verify DKIM is enabled
- Check email headers to see if DKIM signature exists

---

### "All DNS records correct but still blocked"

**Possible issues:**
- IP blacklisted
- Domain has bad reputation
- Content triggers spam filters

**Solutions:**
1. Check IP blacklists
2. Test with mail-tester.com
3. Use SMTP relay service
